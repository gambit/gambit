<p>
This installer will guide you through the installation of
@NAME@ v@VERSION@ (@VARIANT@ variant).
</p>

<p>
Files will be copied to the <code>@INSTALL_DIR@</code>,
<code>@BIN_DIR@</code>, <code>@LIB_DIR@</code>, and <code>@INCLUDE_DIR@</code>
directories.  The <em>Gambit installation
directory</em> <code>@INSTALL_DIR@/v@VERSION@</code> will be created
and <code>@INSTALL_DIR@/current</code> will be a link to that
directory.  The programs added to the <code>@BIN_DIR@</code>, <code>@LIB_DIR@</code>, and <code>@INCLUDE_DIR@</code> directories
are symbolic links to files in the
<code>@INSTALL_DIR@/current</code> directory.  For example,
<code>@BIN_DIR@/gsi</code> is a link to
<code>@INSTALL_DIR@/current/bin/gsi</code>.  After the installation is
finished you can start the Gambit interpreter from a shell simply
by executing the command
</p>

<p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;gsi</code>
</p>

<p>
The installer has checked that it is safe to write into the
<code>@BIN_DIR@</code>, <code>@LIB_DIR@</code>, and <code>@INCLUDE_DIR@</code>
directories (no files will be clobbered).  Gambit
can be uninstalled by executing as root the shell command
</p>

<p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;uninstall-gambit <var>&lt;version&gt;</var></code>
</p>

<p>
If <code><var>&lt;version&gt;</var></code> is omitted the current
version will be uninstalled.  For example the following command will
undo the effects of this installer:
</p>

<p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo uninstall-gambit v@VERSION@</code>
</p>
